    <u><h2>Mercedes-Benz G-Class</h2></u>
    <span>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, colloquially known as the G-Wagon or G-Wagen[3] (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen), is a four-wheel drive luxury SUV manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Graz, Styria, Austria, and sold by Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line. In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature. Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 45 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it.[4] In 2018, Mercedes-Benz introduced the second-generation W463 with heavily revised chassis, powertrain, body, and interior. In 2023, Mercedes-Benz announced plans to launch a smaller version of the G-Class, named "little G"—though no definitive date was given for the launch.[5]</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_G-Class" target="_blank">Know more</a

        <u><h2>Audi A3</h2></u>
    <span>The Audi A3 is a small family car (C-segment) manufactured and marketed by the German automaker Audi AG since September 1996,[1][2] currently in its fourth generation.

        The first two generations of the Audi A3 were based on the Volkswagen Group A platform, while the third and fourth generations use the Volkswagen Group MQB platform.Audi announced the first generation A3 (Typ 8L) in June 1995. The model was launched for the European market in September 1996 and marked Audi's return to small cars after 19 years, following the demise of the Audi 50 in 1978.

        The A3 was the first Volkswagen Group model to use the PQ34 (or "A4") platform, bearing close resemblance to the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, which arrived a year later. Within three years of the A3's launch, the PQ34 platform was utilised by seven different vehicles.</span>

            <span>The Lamborghini Aventador (Spanish pronunciation: [aβentaˈðoɾ]) is a mid-engine, two passenger sports car manufactured and marketed by Lamborghini from 2011 until 2022. Named after a prominent Spanish fighting bull that fought in Zaragoza, Aragón, in 1993,[10][11][12] the Aventador succeeded the Murciélago and was manufactured in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy.[13].The Aventador was launched on 28 February 2011 at the Geneva Motor Show, five months after its initial unveiling in Sant'Agata Bolognese. Internally codenamed LB834, it was designed to replace the then-decade-old Murciélago as the new flagship model.[14][15][16]

                Soon after its unveiling, Lamborghini announced that it had sold 12 cars, with deliveries starting in the second half of 2011.[17] By March 2016, Lamborghini had built 5,000 Aventadors. At the time, it was the second-best selling Lamborghini model ever.[18]

        <u><h2>BMW M3</h2></u>
        <span>The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M GmbH. M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986.

            The initial model was available in a coupé body style, with a convertible body style made available soon after. M3 saloons were offered initially during the E36 (1994–1999) and E90 (2008–2012) generations. Since 2014, the coupé and convertible models have been rebranded as the 4 Series range, making the high-performance variant the M4. Variants of the 3 Series since then have seen the M3 produced as a saloon, until 2020, when the M3 was produced as an estate (Touring) for the first time, alongside the saloon variant.[1][2]</span>
